# cs-ej4101-fall-2019-014-starter
Repository for the starter project of the CS-EJ4101 course in autumn 2019.

In autumn of 2019 I attended the online course "Introduction to DevOps" at Aalto University, through FiTech. 
As a final project we were asked to create a personal website (real or imaginary) using GitHub Pages. Pages were written using MarkDown 
notation.

During the course I learned to use git locally to push content to a GitHub repository. I also learned some Markdown (although 
I personally prefer writing HTML markup myself) and how GitHub pages work to automate the deployment of the webpages.
